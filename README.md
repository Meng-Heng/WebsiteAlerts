# Introduction

This is the GFM Alerts extension for your website; a Parsedown extension; which recognizes the Alert syntax that we see on GitHub Markdown files and converts them rightfully so, along with the stylings. Read five fun facts about **dolphins** while you check out the different types of Alert. 

> [!NOTE] 
> There are 36 species of marine dolphins - living in nearly all aquatic environments, including oceans, coastal, estuarine and freshwater - and in temperatures ranging from less than 0°C to more than 30°C.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Bottlenose dolphins are one of the few species, along with apes and humans, that have the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror.

> [!TIP]
> How do you eat a fish? They swallow a fish head first so the fish's spines don't catch in their throat. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Noise pollution from naval activity, the oil and gas industry, seismic surveys and underwater construction can stress and injure cetaceans.

> [!WARNING]
> Bottlenose dolphins are often killed accidentally in gillnets, driftnets, purse seines, trawls, long-lines and on hook-and-line gear used in fisheries.
