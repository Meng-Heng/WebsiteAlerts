## Usage
This is the Alerts conversion for your website; a Parsedown extension; which recognizes the Alerts syntax that we see on GitHub Markdown files and converts them rightfully so along with the stylings. Read fun facts about dolphins while you check out the different types of Alert.

> [!NOTE] 
> There are 36 species of marine dolphins - living in nearly all aquatic environments, including oceans, coastal, estuarine and freshwater - and in temperatures ranging from less than 0°C to more than 30°C.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Bottlenose dolphins are one of the few species, along with apes and humans, that have the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror.

> [!TIPS]
> **How do you eat a fish?** They swallow a fish head first so the fish's spines don't catch in their throat. 

> [!CAUTION] Noise pollution from naval activity, the oil and gas industry, seismic surveys and underwater construction can stress and injure cetaceans.

> [!WARNING] Bottlenose dolphins are often killed accidentally in gillnets, driftnets, purse seines, trawls, long-lines and on hook-and-line gear used in fisheries.
